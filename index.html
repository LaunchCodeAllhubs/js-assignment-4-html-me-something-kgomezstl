    <img class="Record" src="/images/record-diagram.jpg" />
    <p>The Voyager Golden Records are two identical phonograph records one of each which were included aboard the two Voyager 
      spacecraft launched in 1977. The records contain sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and 
      culture on Earth, and are intended for any intelligent extraterrestrial life form who may find them. The records are 
      a time capsule.

      In the upper left-hand corner is an easily recognized drawing of the phonograph record and the stylus carried with it. 
      The stylus is in the correct position to play the record from the beginning. Written around it in binary arithmetic is 
      the correct time of one rotation of the record, 3.6 seconds, expressed in time units of 0,70 billionths of a second, the 
      time period associated with a fundamental transition of the hydrogen atom. The drawing indicates that the record should 
      be played from the outside in. Below this drawing is a side view of the record and stylus, with a binary number giving
      the time to play one side of the record - about an hour.

    <p>The Voyager 1 probe is currently the farthest human-made object from Earth. Both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have reached interstellar space, the region between stars where the galactic plasma is present. Like their predecessors Pioneer 10 and 11, which featured a simple plaque, both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were launched by NASA with a message aboard—a kind of time capsule, intended to communicate to extraterrestrials a story of the world of humans on Earth.
      This is a present from a small, distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our feelings. We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours.
      
      —President Jimmy Carter</p>
