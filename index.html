    <h1 class="center"> The Voyager's Golden Record Cover</h1>
    <p>In the upper left-hand corner is an easily recognized drawing of the phonograph record and the stylus carried with it. 
      The stylus is in the correct position to play the record from the beginning. Written around it in binary arithmetic is 
      the correct time of one rotation of the record, 3.6 seconds, expressed in time units of 0,70 billionths of a second, the 
      time period associated with a fundamental transition of the hydrogen atom. The drawing indicates that the record should 
      be played from the outside in. Below this drawing is a side view of the record and stylus, with a binary number giving
      the time to play one side of the record - about an hour.
